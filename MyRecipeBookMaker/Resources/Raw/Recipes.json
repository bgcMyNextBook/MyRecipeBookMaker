    "notes": "*One packet of yeast is 2 1/4 teaspoons. If you have packets rather than bulk yeast, it is completely fine to just use one packet of yeast. Different yeast calls for slightly different proofing methods. We follow Red Star Platinumâs temperature guidelines. Please check your yeast packet to see what temperature the milk should be at.\n\n**A note about the butter, we have used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/3 cup many times. We feel it keeps the rolls softer. Give it a try!\n\n***If you donât have cream, use half and half, coffee creamer, evaporated milk, whole milk or coconut cream. Any of these will work. Even 2% milk will work, but we prefer a higher fat milk.\n\nFor smaller rolls, cut the dough into 15 slices and use a 10x15â baking pan. The larger pan will also allow the rolls to rise more evenly.\n\nOur original recipe called for all-purpose flour, but we make them exclusively with bread flour now. Either will work, but bread flour yields a fluffier, sturdier roll with a slightly chewy texture. All-purpose flour gives a softer, more tender roll.\n\nOvernight Instructions\n\nWe often make the cinnamon rolls and get them to the point of the second rise (they are rolled out, cut up and put in the pan). Cover and refrigerate until morning.\n\nThe morning you want to bake them, pull them out of the fridge and let them rise. They may have doubled in size in the fridge overnight. If they have, let them sit for 30 minutes to get the chill off, then bake.\n\nIf they did not rise in the fridge overnight, allow them to rise at room temperature. This could take at least an hour for this. Then pour on the cream and bake.\n\n*The calorie count shows the amount with ALL of the frosting used. There is likely more frosting than one would use on 12 rolls, so the count is slightly elevated."

    "notes": "*One packet of yeast is 2 1/4 teaspoons. If you have packets rather than bulk yeast, it is completely fine to just use one packet of yeast. Different yeast calls for slightly different proofing methods. We follow Red Star Platinumâs temperature guidelines. Please check your yeast packet to see what temperature the milk should be at.\n\n**A note about the butter, we have used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/3 cup many times. We feel it keeps the rolls softer. Give it a try!\n\n***If you donât have cream, use half and half, coffee creamer, evaporated milk, whole milk or coconut cream. Any of these will work. Even 2% milk will work, but we prefer a higher fat milk.\n\nFor smaller rolls, cut the dough into 15 slices and use a 10x15â baking pan. The larger pan will also allow the rolls to rise more evenly.\n\nOur original recipe called for all-purpose flour, but we make them exclusively with bread flour now. Either will work, but bread flour yields a fluffier, sturdier roll with a slightly chewy texture. All-purpose flour gives a softer, more tender roll.\n\nOvernight Instructions\n\nWe often make the cinnamon rolls and get them to the point of the second rise (they are rolled out, cut up and put in the pan). Cover and refrigerate until morning.\n\nThe morning you want to bake them, pull them out of the fridge and let them rise. They may have doubled in size in the fridge overnight. If they have, let them sit for 30 minutes to get the chill off, then bake.\n\nIf they did not rise in the fridge overnight, allow them to rise at room temperature. This could take at least an hour for this. Then pour on the cream and bake.\n\n*The calorie count shows the amount with ALL of the frosting used. There is likely more frosting than one would use on 12 rolls, so the count is slightly elevated."

Fold about one-third of the whites into the batter, then remaining whites. Donât worry if you still see a few white specks, as theyâll disappear during baking."
